# 🛍️ Slooze Inventory, Purchase & Sales Analysis

This project is a take-home challenge by **Slooze**, focused on analyzing large-scale retail data for inventory management, purchase optimization, and sales forecasting.

## 📂 Project Overview

A retail wine & spirits company manages millions of transactions across locations. The goal is to extract actionable insights to improve:
- **Inventory control**
- **Procurement efficiency**
- **Sales forecasting**

## ✅ Objectives

- Determine optimal inventory levels by product category
- Analyze sales/purchase trends and supplier performance
- Implement EOQ, ABC, ROP models for smarter stocking

## 📊 Tasks Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Cleaned and prepared multiple datasets for consistent analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Uncovered patterns in sales, purchases, and inventory across time.

3. **Task 1: Demand Forecasting**  
   Predicted future demand using sales trends and time-series techniques.

4. **Task 2: ABC Analysis**  
   Classified inventory by sales value to prioritize resources.

5. **Task 3: EOQ Analysis**  
   Calculated Economic Order Quantity to reduce holding/ordering costs.

6. **Task 4: Reorder Point Analysis**  
   Identified critical inventory levels using lead times and demand.

7. **Task 5: Lead Time Analysis**  
   Evaluated supplier delays and procurement inefficiencies.
